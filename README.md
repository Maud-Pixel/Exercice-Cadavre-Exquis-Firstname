The cat and the mouse

  Played in the malt-house:
  The cat bit the mouse’s tail off.  “Pray, puss, give me my tail.”
  “No,” says the cat, “I’ll not give you your tail,
till you go to the cow and fetch me some milk.”
  First she leapt, and then she ran,
  Till she came to the cow, and thus began—
  “Pray, cow, give me milk, that I may give cat milk,
that cat may give me my own tail again.
yes it's me !
